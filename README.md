# Electrocardigram IoT Application

A prototype for validating the detection of anomalies in human cardiac behaviour. This application is designed to be used in a limited resource environment, and use edge computing to offload heavier computational tasks to connected devices and the cloud. To realize this, the application uses FreeRTOS to manage IoT resources, and offloads data to a companion Android mobile application
